Ganon - Mobile Actionscript 3 Starling/Feathers Framework

This is a personal framework I created to help quick boot up new apps I build with Adobe AIR for iOS and Android.

This app flow assumes the use of the following:

* Texture Atlases
* BitmapFonts

I use bitmaps as often as possible to help reduce drawcalls. You will need Texture Packager - download here: https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker
